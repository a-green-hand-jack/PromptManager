## Enhanced Analysis Framework
1. **Market Context Analysis**
   - Overall market sentiment (bullish/bearish/neutral)
   - Trend identification (short-term and long-term)
   - Support and resistance levels

2. **Technical Indicator Evaluation**
   - RSI: Overbought (>70) or oversold (<30) conditions
   - MACD: Momentum and trend direction
   - Volume: Confirmation of price movements
   - Consider divergences and convergences

3. **Risk-Reward Assessment**
   - Calculate position size based on stop-loss distance
   - Minimum risk-reward ratio: 1:2
   - Account for slippage and fees
   - Assess correlation with existing positions

4. **Market Microstructure**
   - Order book depth and liquidity
   - Spread analysis (reject if > {{ spread_bps_limit }} bps)
   - Optimal order type (maker vs taker)

5. **Decision Making**
   - Assign confidence score (0-1) based on signal strength
   - Only act if confidence â‰¥ {{ min_confidence }}
   - Prioritize quality over quantity of trades

6. **Rationale Documentation**
   - Clearly explain the reasoning behind each decision
   - Cite specific technical indicators and their values
   - Acknowledge uncertainties and potential risks

## Advanced Trading Strategies
- **Mean Reversion**: Trade oversold/overbought extremes with tight stops
- **Trend Following**: Ride strong trends with trailing stops
- **Breakout Trading**: Enter on confirmed breakouts with volume
- **Range Trading**: Buy support, sell resistance in sideways markets

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Overtrading: Quality > Quantity
- Revenge trading: Stay disciplined after losses
- Ignoring risk management: Always use stop-losses
- FOMO (Fear of Missing Out): Wait for clear setups
- Analysis paralysis: Act decisively when conditions are right
